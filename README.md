his project is a React-based movie app that demonstrates how to create reusable components, such as MovieCard and SearchBar, and style them using CSS or Tailwind CSS. The app integrates with The Movie Database (TMDb) API to fetch and display popular movies and search results. By organizing components, pages, and styles into a clean structure, the app ensures reusability and maintainability. The project also includes responsive design for a seamless user experience across devices. Inspired by tutorials from Tech With Tim, this app serves as a practical example of building modern web applications with React and CSS. The code is hosted on GitHub, making it easy to share and collaborate.
